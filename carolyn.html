      I am a currently a junior at the University of Southern California’s School of Cinematic Arts, majoring in Media Arts + Practice with a minor in Dance and Computer Programming.

      I grew up in San Jose, CA with a strong background in performing arts while simultaneously retaining an interest in technology and film production. I am trained in classical piano, dance, singing, acting, and am well-versed in a variety of coding languages and software programs. Through my studies and work experience, I have gained a rich knowledge of interaction design and storytelling technique. I have an earnest curiosity in finding a way to combine these disciplines.

      Currently, I still enjoy performing and am on USC’s basketball dance team, Trojan Dance Force. I am a signed actress in the LA area and enjoy participating in USC student films. I also serve as the official photographer for USC’s Kaufman School of Dance as well as run my own photography business on the side (checkout my photography here).

      I aspire to apply my interests in entertainment and technology in my future professional involvements. In all the work I do, I think about the potential impact on our society, retaining a passionate awareness regarding social justice. I am always open to new opportunities and projects where I can gain new skills as well as apply my own.
