      <p><font size="-1" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Paul DiLoreto</strong> needs your help to go to musical theatre training in New York this summer. Yes, Paul is going to Broadway! He was one of 32 kids  across the country to be accepted at NYU's Tisch Program among hundreds of applicants. Some consider this program to be the most prestigeous in the country for high-school-age students. The four-week program program places Paul among elite performers his age and among the best teachers Broadway has to offer.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In addition, the program provides 6 units of college credit. Paul is entering his senior year at Bellarmine College Prep. After graduation, he hopes to study both computer science and performing arts. This summer progam will help his acceptance at a major university.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, this opportunity for Paul does not come cheaply. Tuition for the NYU summer program is over $8 thousand dollars. We are asking for your help. Any amount you may care to give, no matter how small, will be sincerely appreciated.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Those who know Paul, recognize his talent for performing at an early age, widely recognized as a natural singer. In his first theatre role at age 9, he landed the title role in <em>Pinocchio</em> at Children's Musical Theatre San Jose. Since then he has been in almost two dozen theatre productions, often winning major roles &mdash; some pictured here.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Paul continues to study voice and dance with two of the best teachers in the area as part of his commitment to this discipline.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you could help Paul with his theatre education fund, please click on the link below or send a check to The DiLoreto's, 960 Dry Creek Road, Campbell, CA 95008. We appreciate your support!</font>
