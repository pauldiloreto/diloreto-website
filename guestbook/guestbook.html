<b>Hi John, Thanks for leading me to your Di Loreto website. It is an outstanding 
compilation of Alfedena information. I especially liked the homemade map of the 
principal landmarks in the village including your family homesteads. My grandparents, 
Carlo Di Valerio and Dorotea Spada lived on the Via di Casini in Alfedena before 
emigrating to Erie, Pa. in 1906. Growing up in Erie in the 30's and 40's I remember 
a Di L oreto family in the neighborhood, but as yet I can't place the location 
of the Nick and M ary Di Loreto storefront. It looks like it may be on 18th St. 
in the Italian district of Erie. I grew up on 18th and Walnut Streets there, just 
a half block from the office of Dr. Quentin Orlando, who I see was a speaker at 
your Di Loreto reunion in 1965. I visited Alfedena when I was in the Army in 1955 
and stayed with two cousins of my grandmother, Leontina Spada and Rosina Turchi. 
I have only been back once, about four yea rs ago with my wife, but we were only 
able to spend a few hours there. Keep up the good work wi th your website and 
I'll visit it often. Richard</b><br>

<b>Mr. DiLoreto, I really enjoyed the postcards of Alfedena. I was born there 
in the early 50's. One of the postcards actually had the house that I lived in 
until I was 13. I was also looking at the photos taken by soldier DiLoreto, the 
ones on top of the people sitting on the terrace have a background that does not 
belong to Alfedena. I see a dome and an open tower, no such landmark s in town. 
My parents will be visiting in may and they might recognize people or things, 
I'll keep in touch.....Marcello</b><br>
