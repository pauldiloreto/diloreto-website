        Recreation Center, guests of the <b><a href="index.html"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><em>DiLoreto 
        Mountain Home</em></font></a></b> are privileged to visit the Recreation 
        Center at no charge. The Recreation Center is open from Memorial Day to 
        Labor Day. It's open just on weekends until the third week of June and 
        7 days a week until Labor day. </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">DIRECTIONS: The recreation center is located only about 
        a half-mile away from the house. You pass by it on the way in. To get 
        there from the house, go back to Sierra Parkway and turn left. When the 
        road divides, stay to the right and make a U-turn when the divide ends. 
        Not the first drive right there, but the next one is where you turn into 
        the parking lot. </font></p></td>
