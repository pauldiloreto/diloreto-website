  AND THE CINCE</font></b><br>
  <i>as told to me in 1961...</i></p>
<p align="left">Tonce upon a whime, there was a gritty little pearl named Prinderella. 
  She had two sisty uglers and a micked wepstother. Poor Prinderella had to wean 
  the clindows, frub the scloors, and do all the wirdy derk.</p>
<p align="left">One day the Ping issued a Krocklamation. All geligible irls were 
  invited to a Drancy Fess Ball! The two sisty uglers had drancy fesses. But Prinderella 
  didn't, so she cat down and scried...</p>
<p align="left">When along came her Merry Fodgother. &quot;No drancy fess,&quot; 
  sobbed Prinderella. So, in the eyeling of a twink, the Merry Fodgother made 
  Prinderella a drancy fess, and turned a cumpkin into a parridge!</p>
<p align="left">Prinderella pranced all night with the Cince. But...at the moke 
  of stridnight, she ran down the stalace beps. And at the stottom bep, she slopped 
  her dripper!!!</p>
<p align="left">The dext nay the Ping issued another Krocklamation. All gelibible 
  irls were to sly on the tripper. The two sisty uglers slied on the tripper. 
  But it fidn't dit. But then Prinderella slied on the tripper...and it FID DIT!</p>
