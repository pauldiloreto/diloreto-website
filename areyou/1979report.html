<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>“IN DARKNESS DUELS

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The roots of the Di Loreto family
are found in two towns in the central Appenine Mountains of Italy in the
Abruzzi region, Barrea and Alfedena. The towns, at about 3300 feet above sea
level, are nestled on the north sides of the Meta Mountains, located 77.5 air
miles (125 km) east of Rome and 64.5 air miles (104 km) north of Naples. The
chain runs west-south east, south of the towns and rises to 2300 meters or 7500
feet. From its peaks, it is possible to see Rome, the Vesuvius and the Adriatic
Sea.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The name Barrea is derived from
“Vallis Regia” through the later “Varreggia”. Little is know of the ancient
history of Barrea but recent excavations (1950-1970) carried out by one of our
cousins Dr. Oscar Di Loreto (1911-1971) have shown that the town was part of
the Marsican and Samnite tribes in 300-200 B.C.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The history of Alfedena is well
attested by the excavations, which started in 1885 with A. De Nino, and in 1897
the civic Museum was organized. During World War II, the collection was
recovered at Chieti and is still waiting to be returned to Alfedena to be
housed in a proper building. The artifacts consist mainly of bronze coins,
arms, medals, ornaments and assorted ceramic vases, all recovered from the more
than 1500 tombs excavated in the Roman necropolis in what is now Viale della
Stazione, the road that leads to the railroad station.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Aufidena (Alfedena) was the capital
of the Caraceni, a tribe of the Samnites and was situated north of the present
main square on the left side of the Rio Torto, the small stream that divides
the town. The remaining megalithic walls, about a mile long, are seen together
with distinct evidence of the acropolis. It is interesting to know that of the
original Italian tribes, which tried to block the expansion of Rome, the
Samnites were the only ones, which actually defeated the Roman legions. In 321
B.C., at the Forche Caudine, the Romans were made to pass under a yoke.
However, victory was short-lived. Aufidena was conquered by the roman consul
Gneo Fulvio and by 272 B.C. Rome was master of what is now central and most of
southern Italy. Aufidena became a faithful roman colony.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The wanderlust of the Alfedenesi
developed many centuries ago and, in the Annals of Tacitus, Book 1, we see that
“Aufidenius Rufus” who was a camp commandant, having been advanced from private
to centurion, was instrumental in fighting the Roman troops, which had rebelled
in Pannonia (Austria) after the death of Emperor Augustus in 14 A.D. Because of
its faithful service to Rome, its strategic location, controlling the mountain
passes of the north/south route from the Adriatic to the Tyrrenian Sea, and the
east/west route to Rome, Alfedena received the designation of Ala Fidelis
(Loyal Wing), the A – F of the coat of arms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>For several centuries, the Abruzzi
region shared the fate of Italy, that is, internal wars and occupation by
invaders. During the Middle Ages, the region was ruled by barons, princes at
the service of the German, Spanish, French Emperors or Popes. In 1860 with the
fall of the Bourbon kingdom of Naples, the Abruzzi became part of the kingdom
of Italy until June 1946, when the present Republic was established.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>During the early middle Ages, the
inhabitants moved away from the stony hills on the left side of the Rio Torto
to the flat land at the right. The land was and is very poor but the forests
and stones are plentiful, hence making of charcoal and stone cutting developed.
Most of the streets of medieval Rome were paved by the “selciaroli” from
Alfedena, who are also responsible for developing the many stone quarries found
in the Alban Hills. Alfedenesi have roamed, paving streets in England, Belgium,
Germany, Romania, North Africa.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>At about 1880, the temporary and
later permanent migration to our country began and, as we know, there are more
Alfedenesi in Detroit than at any time in Alfedena.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>As mentioned, the Di Loreto root is
from Barrea, where the family was the landed gentry of the town. Several
branches of the family still exist and during the 19<sup>th</sup> century
contributed outstanding citizens to law, medicine, commerce, church, and the
Army and Navy, traditions which are still continuing. Our grandfather Panfilo,
following his schooling in Naples in 1871-72, until his coming to U.S.A in
1913, was the Segretario Comunale (City Clerk) for the towns of Montenero and
Scontrone, a nonelected job under the direct supervision of the provincial
authorities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The other root, the Gigante, is
unique. There is only on family in town with that name. Incomplete records
indicate that the family originated in Atina, a town on the southern slope of
the Meta Mountains about 20 air miles from Alfedena. The Roman bridge Ponte d’Achille,
next to the Gigante’s house carried an inscription commemorating the alliance
with Veroli and Atina. Church records, now destroyed, mentioned a bishop
Gigante, and until recently, the altar to the right of the main altar of the
higher church was reserved for the descendants of the Gigante family. The
family possessed some very desirable land, the “Vigne” and “Le Corone” south-west
of the Piazza and in via Casili a garden, stables and a carriage house. On a
wall, about 30 feet long, there were frescoes which, supposedly, had been
painted by the renowned Cola d’Amatrice or his school in residence of Maria,
the youngest daughter of Alfonso and Elvira Gigante. The Gigante family was
engaged in various commercial and civic activities. Since the end of the last century
to the present, the family has given several mayors and many professionals to
the town.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The roots were unquestionably
strong and transplanted in our country with its freedom and unlimited
opportunities, the many trees can only continue to grow.</p>
