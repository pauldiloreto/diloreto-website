        </b></p>
      <p><b> <font size="4"><u>We came from Alfedena</u>. </font></b>Like many 
        DiLoreto's, our immediate ancestors came from the town of Alfedena, L'Aquila, 
        Italy, in which 700 inhabitants remain today. Other DiLoretos come from 
        the nearby town of Barrea. The recorded beginnings of our <a href="#" onClick=window.open("PasqualeTree.gif","","width=428,height=582")>family tree</a> 
        dates from the mid-seventeenth century. 
      </p>
      <p>Our grandfather, Remo DiLoreto was one of 13 children of Panfilo DiLoreto 
        and Eufrasia Gigante. Remo emigrated in 1909. His his large family were 
        part of a wide migration from these two towns to the United States at 
        the turn of the 20th century. A <a href="#" onClick=window.open("FamilyTree.gif","","width=595,height=720")>hand-drawn 
        family tree shows</a> these siblings, their spouses and emigration and 
        marriage dates. </p>
      <p>In 1911, Remo married Marianna (Mary) D'Amico, one of 11 children, also 
        from Alfedena. They settled in the Eastern Market area of Detroit, raising 
        three sons, Panfilo, Oscar and Gilbert and a daughter, Emma. From them, 
        there are 12 first-cousins, six of us carring the family name to the next 
        generation.</p>
      <p>A genealogical record of the DiLoreto lineage is maintained, and we would 
        love to hear from any relatives with updates. An updated copy of the complete 
        family tree can be sent as a PDF to family members. Please contact <a href="../guestbook/addguest.html">DiLoreto.com</a>.</p>
      <p><b><font size="4"><u>The Loyal Wing Club</u>.</font></b> Many &quot;Alfedenesi&quot; 
        settled in Detroit, beginning in 1886 with the DiFilippo's and DiFalco's. 
        By 1900 there were 100 Alfedesi in Detroit, helping to build stone buildings 
        before there was concrete. In 1960 it was reported that there were more 
        people from Alfedena and their descendants living in Detroit (1,680), 
        than Alfedena's population at the time (1,430). By 1979 the number in 
        Detroit swelled to 2 to 3 thousand. They founded the Loyal Wing Club in 
        1919 and leased 72 acres on Soft Water Lake, north of Pontiac, the article 
        said. In 1960 they opened a clubhouse at 11250 Hayes, sold in 1984. The 
        club is said to meet at the Italian-American Cultural Center in Warren.</p>
      <p>150 attended a 1965 DiLoreto Family Reunion in Harper Woods, Michigan, 
        whose <a href="#" onClick=window.open("reunionprogram.gif","","width=825,height=633")>program</a> 
        outlines the the complete family lineage from Panfilo and 
        Eufrasia to that day. Since that time, a genealogical database has been 
        compiled of over 500 their decendants, as well as acestors dating back 
        to the mid-1600's. The oldest portion of the DiLoreto Family tree is reproduced 
        <a href="#" onClick=window.open("PasqualeTree.gif","","width=428,height=582")>here</a>.

      <p><b><u><font size="4">Alfedena History</font></u><font size="4">.</font></b> 
        A 1960 article in the Detroit Free Press accounts that Alfedena was given 
        its name from its distinguished defense of Rome from Hannibal in 216 B 
        .C., after which Imperial Rome bestowed the title &quot;Ala Fidelis,&quot; 
        or &quot;Loyal Wing.&quot; Ancient &quot;Aufidena&quot; was home to many 
        stonecutters, which paved most of the streets of midieval Rome and later 
        paved streets throughout Europe and North Africa, according to a <a href="1979report.html">report 
        by Armand DiGuilio</a>, the oldest grandchild of Panfilo and Eufrasia, 
        given at a 1979 DiLoreto family reunion.</p>

        DiLoreto, still in the service, visited Alfedena after World War II, he

      <p><b><font size="4"><u>Geography</u>.</font></b>&nbsp; Alfedena is located 
        north of Naples and a three-hour drive east of Rome, on the south edge 
        of the province of L'Aquila and of the Abruzzi region. It is situated 
        on the Sangro River at an elevation of about 3000 feet in the craggy foothills 
        of the Appenine Mountains, just north of the Meta Mountains. A small stream 
        called Rio Torto divides the town with the main square and stony hills 
        on the left. The flat land on the right was inhabited from the early Middle 
        ages. See maps below.</p>
      <p><font size="4"><b><u>Family Name History</u>.</b> </font></p>
      <p align="center"><i>From The Historical Research Center<br>
        Submittedby Joanne Monroe,&nbsp; 1993</i></p>
      <p><font size="2">The Italian surname DiLoreto is local in origin, being 
        one of those surnames derived from the name of the place where the original 
        bearer once lived or owned land. In this case, the surname composed of 
        two elements, &quot;Di&quot; and &quot;Loreto,&quot; is derived from the 
        place named Loreto, located in the province of Ancona, on the eastern 
        coast of Italy. This town became a famous place of pilgrimage because 
        of the &quot;Holy House&quot; located there. This shrine was said to have 
        been the home of the Virgin Mary in Nazareth and (according to legend) 
        was brought to Loreto by Angels in 1295.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">Before the advent of a formal system of hereditary family 
        surnames, it was comon practice to name a person according to his place 
        of origin. With the growth of documentation in the later Middle Ages, 
        surnames became essential and people therefore registered using the names 
        by which they were known.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">DiLoreto was the surname of a noble Italian family that 
        came to prominence in the fourteenth century, when King Robert made Bernardo 
        Cristofor the first Count di Loreto in the year 1330. Another notable 
        family were the di Loreto of Genua. Of this family, one Luca di Loreto 
        is mentioned for the year 1528. The following is the coat of arms for 
        the di Loreto family of Genua:</font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><b>Blazon&nbsp; of Arms</b>: Azure, a tree on a grassy 
        plain all proper, overall a fess gules.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><b>Translation:</b>The tree is the symbol of Antiquity 
        and knowledge. The fesse is a horizontal partition signifying the Military 
        Belt and Girdle of Honor worn in ancient times.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><b>Crest:</b> Three ostrich plumes proper.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><b>Origin:</b> Italy</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">From the <b>Istituto Genealogico Italiano</b></font> comes 
        an &quot;Historical and Heraldic Information on the DiLoreto Stock&quot; 
        translated from Italian as follows:</p>
      <font size="2"> 
      <p>The DI LORETO Family vaunts its descendance from the very ancient stock 
        of the D'Aquino, of Longobard origin, and acknowledges as its forefather 
        one Atenolfo, Lord of Capua in 996.</p>
      <p>The Family owned several feuds, amongst which the most important were: 
        the County of Aquino from which it drew its name (996), Acerra (1121), 
        Alife (1205), the County of Loreto (1330), the Marquisates of Pescara 
        (1412) and of Atessa; the Duchies of Gaeta (1050) and of Bisceglie (1536) 
        and the Principality of Castiglione (1002).</p>
      <p>They were extremely prolific people, so that they divided into a great 
        number of families: the Alvito delle Grotte, Acerra, Santomango, Castiglione 
        and DI LORETO, so named from the feuds they owned.</p>
      <p>The important branch that affirmed itself by the name of DI LORETO starts 
        with Berardo, son of the count Cristoforo, who in 1330 was invested of 
        the county of Loreto by King Roberto of Anjou in reward for his services 
        rendered to the Crown.</p>
      <p>Cristoforo was in fact Chamberlain to King Roberto, and distinguished 
        himself for having held with courage and skill the office of Captain General 
        and Justiciar in the Principality of Ultra.</p>
      <p>The same King Roberto entrusted to Berardo, Count of Loreto a delicate 
        embassy to Hungary, but the Hungarians held as prisoners the envoys of 
        the Anjevin King who was compelled to arm a galeon at Viesti, and sent 
        it to rescue the Count of Loreto and the other ambassadors who were thus 
        able to return to Naples.</p>
      <p>Taken as a whole the stock of the DI LORETO that branched in the centres 
        of the Abruzzi, is always composed of the great grand children of the 
        Counts of Aquino who had vast feudal posessions, privileges, princely 
        honours, power and fame of nobility in the Kingdom of Naples.</p>
