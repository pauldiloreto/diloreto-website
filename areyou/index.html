            The DI LORETO Family vaunts its descendance from the very ancient stock of the D'Aquino, of Longobard origin, and acknowledges as its forefather one Atenolfo, Lord of Capua in 996.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Family owned several feuds, amongst which the most important were: the County of Aquino from which it drew its name (996), Acerra (1121), Alife (1205), the County of Loreto (1330), the Marquisates of Pescara (1412) and of Atessa; the Duchies of Gaeta (1050) and of Bisceglie (1536) and the Principality of Castiglione (1002).
          </p>
          <p>
            They were extremely prolific people, so that they divided into a great number of families: the Alvito delle Grotte, Acerra, Santomango, Castiglione and DI LORETO, so named from the feuds they owned.

            The important branch that affirmed itself by the name of DI LORETO starts with Berardo, son of the count Cristoforo, who in 1330 was invested of the county of Loreto by King Roberto of Anjou in reward for his services rendered to the Crown. Cristoforo was in fact Chamberlain to King Roberto, and distinguished himself for having held with courage and skill the office of Captain General and Justiciar in the Principality of Ultra.
          </p>
          <p>
            The same King Roberto entrusted to Berardo, Count of Loreto a delicate embassy to Hungary, but the Hungarians held as prisoners the envoys of the Anjevin King who was compelled to arm a galeon at Viesti, and sent it to rescue the Count of Loreto and the other ambassadors who were thus able to return to Naples.
          </p>
          <p>
            Taken as a whole the stock of the DI LORETO that branched in the centres of the Abruzzi, is always composed of the great grand children of the Counts of Aquino who had vast feudal posessions, privileges, princely honours, power and fame of nobility in the Kingdom of Naples.

              The Italian surname DiLoreto is local in origin, being one of those surnames derived from the name of the place where the original bearer once lived or owned land. In this case, the surname composed of two elements, "Di" and "Loreto," is derived from the place named Loreto, located in the province of Ancona, on the eastern coast of Italy. This town became a famous place of pilgrimage because of the "Holy House" located there. This shrine was said to have been the home of the Virgin Mary in Nazareth and (according to legend) was brought to Loreto by Angels in 1295.
            </p>
            <p>
              DiLoreto was the surname of a noble Italian family that came to prominence in the fourteenth century, when King Robert made Bernardo Cristofor the first Count di Loreto in the year 1330. Another notable family were the di Loreto of Genua. Of this family, one Luca di Loreto is mentioned for the year 1528.

              Like many DiLoreto's, our immediate ancestors came from the town of Alfedena, a comune in the province of L'Aquila of the Abruzzo region of central Italy, in which 700 inhabitants remain today. Other DiLoretos come from the nearby town of Barrea. The recorded beginnings of our family tree dates from the mid-seventeenth century.

              Alfedena is located north of Naples and a three-hour drive east of Rome, on the south edge of the province of L'Aquila and of the Abruzzi region. It is situated on the Sangro River at an elevation of about 3000 feet in the craggy foothills of the Appenine Mountains, just north of the Meta Mountains. A small stream called Rio Torto divides the town with the main square and stony hills on the left. The flat land on the right was inhabited from the early Middle ages.

              Many "Alfedenesi" settled in Detroit, beginning in 1886 with the DiFilippo's and DiFalco's. By 1900 there were 100 Alfedesi in Detroit, helping to build stone buildings before there was concrete. In 1960 it was reported that there were more people from Alfedena and their descendants living in Detroit (1,680), than Alfedena's population at the time (1,430). By 1979 the number in Detroit swelled to 2 to 3 thousand.

              They founded the Loyal Wing Club in 1919 and leased 72 acres on Soft Water Lake, north of Pontiac, the article said. In 1960 they opened a clubhouse at 11250 Hayes, sold in 1984. The club is said to meet at the Italian-American Cultural Center in Warren.

              A 1960 article in the Detroit Free Press accounts that Alfedena was given its name from its distinguished defense of Rome from Hannibal in 216 B .C., after which Imperial Rome bestowed the title "Ala Fidelis," or "Loyal Wing."

              Remo DiLoreto was one of 13 children of Panfilo DiLoreto and Eufrasia Gigante. Remo emigrated in 1909. His large family were part of a wide migration from these two towns to the United States at the turn of the 20th century. A hand-drawn family tree shows these siblings, their spouses and emigration and marriage dates.

              In 1911, Remo married Marianna (Mary) D'Amico, one of 11 children, also from Alfedena. They settled in the Eastern Market area of Detroit, raising three sons, Panfilo, Oscar and Gilbert and a daughter, Emma. From them, there are 12 first-cousins, six of us carrying the family name to the next generation.
